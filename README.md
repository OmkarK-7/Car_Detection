# Automatic Car Detection using YOLO

## Project Overview

This project implements automatic car detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. It is based on the concepts taught in the Deep Learning Specialization course on Coursera, instructed by Andrew Ng.

### Key Features:

- Utilizes YOLO for real-time object detection
- Focuses specifically on car detection
- Implements concepts from a renowned deep learning course

## About YOLO

YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect multiple objects in an image in a single forward pass of the neural network. It's known for its speed and accuracy, making it ideal for applications like autonomous driving.

## Course Reference

This project is inspired by and based on the knowledge gained from the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera, created by Andrew Ng. The course provides a comprehensive understanding of deep learning techniques, including advanced computer vision algorithms like YOLO.
